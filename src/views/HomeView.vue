    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
      specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
      electronic typesetting, <a class="link">remaining essentially</a> unchanged. It was popularised in
      the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
      and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
      including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
